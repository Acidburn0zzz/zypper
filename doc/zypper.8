.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
zypper is a command\-line interface to ZYPP system management library. It can be used to install, update, remove software, manage installation sources, perform various searches, and more.

zypper is designed to be compatible with rug, which is a command\-line interface to the ZENworks Linux Management (ZLM) agent. Compared to rug, zypper does not need the ZLM daemon to run, and is intented to provide more and improved functionality.
