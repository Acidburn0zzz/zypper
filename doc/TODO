1.2.x - development releases

+ nice overall install progress with ETA
+ --from option for the installing commands (in/up/patch/dup/inr/verify)
+ add help texts for all prompts

1.0.x - bugfixing for SLE11 and openSUSE 11.1


NOT SCHEDULED
-------------

+ - we want it
? - idea

General

+ improved install summary, extended info available via prompt options
  + show changelog for selected packages or the whole update
  + show graphical (schubi's widget) or ascii dependency tree of the packages
    in the summary
  + explain why a package has been selected for installation/removal
+ options to install/remove packages recommended/suggested packages
+ testsuite
+ exit gracefully in first SIGINT, immediately on the second (needs proper
  implementation)
? xml input (feed an xml with operation specification to zypper)
? move -vv output to zypper.log, leave only normal and verbose output levels?
  -vv e.g. displays full urls of downloaded files

Repository management

+ remake --force to do what user intuitively expects, needs to be defined, e.g.
  - reinstall instead of saying "already installed"
  - downgrade/upgrade from specified repo if --repo foo --force is used
  - etc...
+ zypper.conf option to choose whether to show alias or name in various output

Updating

+ cron updater: wrapper script for restart-packager after packager-affecting
  patches have been installed

Packages

+ just download, don't install. Compare to YOU: do not delete after installing
+ 'zypper up' should show the difference between 'zypper lu' and 'lu --all'
  as  "these packages have been kept back" (like apt does).
  User can upgrade such packages with 'zypper in foo' then.
? list packages newly added to repos since last update (might be easy once we
  have package history)

Patterns

+ implement pattern removal
