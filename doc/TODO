0.10.x
- improve command line arguments handling (be more user-friendly,
  do the obvious stuff automatically, e.g. use -C automatically after typing
  zypper in subversion=1.5.0)
- xml output for all (or most of the) commands
- xml input (feed a xml with operation specification to zypper)
- implement all rug commands (where it makes sense)
- system consistency verification command
- drop xu command (as soon as 'zypper -x lu -t patch -t package is ready')


NOT SCHEDULED
-------------

General

- detect whether the terminal we are writing to supports used control sequences
  and fall back to OutNoTerminal (make it a child of OutNormal) if not. Usefull
  also in cases where the output is redirected to a file or pipe.
- enumerate prompt answers for all prompts
- provide ? for help on prompts (except for Yes/No)
? script progress: does the output contain newline?
- installation and deletion notifications
- confirm license: more user friendly (see confirm_licenses() comment)
- testsuite
? move -vv output to zypper.log, leave only normal and verbose output levels?

Patches

- respect license-to-confirm (test on kernel patch)
 (svn up ncurses)
? reboot-needed: ?
? cron updater:
- wrapper script for restart-packager
- zypper patch-search (for rug compatibility)

Packages

- install
	--force-install option
- just download, not install. compare to YOU: do not delete after installing



Cool Stuff

(document it, brag around)
