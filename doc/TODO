1.0.x - bugfixing for SLE11 and openSUSE 11.1


NOT SCHEDULED
-------------

+ - we want it
? - idea

General

+ more options in the media error prompt (e.g. eject CD)
+ testsuite
? xml input (feed an xml with operation specification to zypper)
? move -vv output to zypper.log, leave only normal and verbose output levels?
  -vv e.g. displays full urls of downloaded files
? remake --force to do what user intuitively expects, needs to be defined, e.g.
  - reinstall instead of saying "already installed"
  - downgrade/upgrade from specified repo if --repo foo --force is used
  - etc...

Updating

+ cron updater: wrapper script for restart-packager after packager-affecting
  patches have been installed

Packages

+ just download, don't install. Compare to YOU: do not delete after installing
? zypper up -t package should show the difference between zypper lu -t package
  and current summary as  "these packages have been kept back" (like apt does).
  User can upgrade such packages with 'zypper in foo' then.
? list packages newly added to repos since last update (might be easy once we
  have package history)

Patterns

+ implement pattern removal
