1.1.x - development releases
1.0.x - bugfixing for SLE11 and openSUSE 11.1

NOT SCHEDULED
-------------

+ - we want it
? - idea

General

+ configuration file (.zypperrc)
+ nice overall install progress
+ improved install summary, extended info available via prompt options
  + show version/arch/vendor changes
  + show recommended and suggested packages
  + show changelog for selected packages or the whole update
  + and more...
+ more options in the media error prompt (e.g. eject CD)
+ testsuite
+ add help texts for prompts
? xml input (feed an xml with operation specification to zypper)
? move -vv output to zypper.log, leave only normal and verbose output levels?
  -vv e.g. displays full urls of downloaded files

Updating

+ cron updater: wrapper script for restart-packager after packager-affecting
  patches have been installed
+ zypper up --some-option repofoo (like 'rug up repo'?) - update
  packages from specified repos without disabling the others
+ zypper lu --some-option to make it list any newer versions of installed
  packages, regardless whether they are installable or not.

Packages

+ just download, don't install. Compare to YOU: do not delete after installing
? zypper up -t package should show the difference between zypper lu -t package
  and current summary as  "these packages have been kept back" (like apt does).
  User can upgrade such packages with 'zypper in foo' then.
? list packages newly added to repos since last update (might be easy once we
  have package history)

Patterns

+ implement pattern removal
+ options to install/remove packages recommended/suggested packages
