NOT SCHEDULED
-------------

+ - we want it
? - idea

General

+ testsuite
? xml input (feed an xml with operation specification to zypper)
? move -vv output to zypper.log, leave only normal and verbose output levels?
  -vv e.g. displays full urls of downloaded files

Updating

+ cron updater: wrapper script for restart-packager after packager-affecting
  patches have been installed
+ zypper up --some-option repofoo (like 'rug up repo'?) - update
  packages from specified repos without disabling the others

Packages

+ just download, don't install. Compare to YOU: do not delete after installing
? zypper up -t package should show the difference between zypper lu -t package
  and current summary as  "these packages have been kept back" (like apt does).
  User can upgrade such packages with 'zypper in foo' then.
? list packages newly added to repos since last update (might be easy once we
  have package history)
