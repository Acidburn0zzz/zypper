NOT SCHEDULED
-------------

General

- xml input (feed a xml with operation specification to zypper)
- detect whether the terminal we are writing to supports used control sequences
  and fall back to OutNoTerminal (make it a child of OutNormal) if not. Usefull
  also in cases where the output is redirected to a file or pipe.
  DONE in OutNormal, TODO via OutNoTerminal?
- enumerate prompt answers for all prompts
? script progress: does the output contain newline?
- installation and deletion notifications
- testsuite
? move -vv output to zypper.log, leave only normal and verbose output levels?

Patches

- respect license-to-confirm (test on kernel patch)
 (svn up ncurses)
? reboot-needed: ?
- cron updater: wrapper script for restart-packager

Packages

- just download, not install. compare to YOU: do not delete after installing

Cool Stuff

(document it, brag around)
- zypper in -t language zh_CN
